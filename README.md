Carousel Prototype
=================

Prototyping some of the animations in the signup and login flow in Carousel. It was pretty fun because this app is beautiful.

**Time spent:** 20+ hours. Struggled with refactoring the code in the login screen to be minimal using loops. Initially I repeated the code block 6 timess. Looked pretty sad. Another challenge was the keyboard animation stuff. I had a few bugs that took forever to figure out. I also started working on the tutorial, but ran out of time and decided to submit what I had so far.

**Tasks completed:** Almost everything. Not the tutorial though. Would love to learn more about NSUserDefaults.
